## Why do we need a dashboard

In today's business environment, the tendency is towards more and more data â€“ so much so that its called Big Data. Managing and extracting
real value from all the data that is created and stored from all the apps and systems we use is quickly becoming a "BIG" challenge facing
all businesses whether your small or large.
Through the use of data visualizations and data analytics, data-driven organizations need to simplify complex processes into manageable,
digestible chunks of information so that employees can focus on their day to day operations of the business thru flexible business
dashboard software. Seeking ways to simplify data analysis and sharing insights to make data driven decisions is no longer a luxury and
never been easier with the ease of sharing complex data sets to provide users with at a glance awareness of current performance that can
be shared in a multitude of ways including mobile, wallboards, PDF reports, TVs and much more.
Use dashboard reporting to track and monitor all your key performance indicators and business metrics in one place.A well designed
dashboard is a remarkable and simple way to share information when and where needed.
